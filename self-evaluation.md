# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
 For generating information for a lot of elements within an array, such as personalized greetings on a website.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? I definitely need to spend more time refining my google search terms for finding methods that I dont know, such as the square root exercise or filtering names with a "P" only.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? When I got stuck, I stepped away and when I returned remembered that there was someone in the study hall! Just being able to talk it out with someone was very helpful and some things just clicked.
